      <description>Ever since I upgraded to Mavericks my Neovim experience in tmux had been less than ideal. It was the oddest behavior and so minor I told myself I could deal with it. I told myself it wasnâ€™t so bad for a long while. For reasons beyond my understanding, I could no longer use my ^H key to move to the left pane in Neovim. I could ^L to go right, ^J for the pane below, or even ^K for the pane above.</description>
